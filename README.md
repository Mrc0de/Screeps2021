# Screeps2021
New Refactored Screeps (2020+)

# Notes
- When near death, make screep 'elder', wrap up tasks and return to spawn for recycling energy
- Mining Spot Roster and Map in memory of Spawn (screeps access)
- screep decides what to do, not the spawn, but the spawn owns all screeps in room
- when screep changes room, new (our)spawn owns or no spawn owns them, screep decides where to go and what to do
- Spawn can broadcast requests, screeps can respond, or not respond
